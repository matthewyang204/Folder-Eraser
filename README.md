# Folder-Eraser
This is a Mac app that trashes the contents of the current selected folder(s). It is useful if you want to trash the files in a folder but not the folder itself.

Requirements: macOS 12 (Monterey) or later

Latest version: 1.0

Download it here:

To install:

1. Download the disk image. It will look like a folder, but it will anyway be a disk image because it has the .dmg file extension.
2. Mount the image (the disk icon is also of a folder) and drag the app to the folder that the arrow points to (an alias of your on-disk Applications folder). It might prompt you to enter your admin password, enter it if your Mac asks. The app will now be in your Applications folder.
3. Enable Full Disk access in System Settings by adding it to the list (the app also looks like a folder) and then making sure that the toggle is on (this is important so that it can access folders to erase).

To use:

1. Select the folders you want to erase (you can only erase subfolders in the same folder at once) in the pop-up dialog.
2. Click the "Open" button.
3. Empty the trash.
